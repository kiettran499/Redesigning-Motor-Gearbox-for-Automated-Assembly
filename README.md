## Description

- This project is to propose a plan to automate the Assembly, Insertion, and Retrieval process for the Motor Gearbox Assembly.
- There are 3 main areas of focus:
  - Assembly Line Design: include the type of lines, number of stations, role of each station, means to move the parts between the stations.
  - Hardware Specification: propose the selection of Feeding machine, Vibratory feeder trough, Manipulator, Conveyor system, End-effecto, PLC controller.
  - Part Re-design for Automated assembly: propose new design to suit the automated assembly line.
- A 3D physical prototype of the new Motor Gearbox Assembly is printed using RMIT Stereolithography printers to test its operation.
  
## Proposal of Design

- Based on the design for manual assembly, the proposal of new design for automated assembly is:
  - The number of parts is minimized or reduced.
  - The Cover side now is added with snap fit to attach with the other side without a strap or screws.
  - The number of screws is reduced from 5 to 3.
  - The parts should have a chamfer to easily align and reduce the insertion time.
  - The cost and time consuming with time cycle during operation must be reduced.

- The proposal of New Automated Assembly Line: 
  - Adopting a conveyor assembly system.
  - Projected to contain seven stations, each having at least six robotic arm stations for handling and insertion.
  - A worker, who is involved in the unload stage of product assembly, can determine whether or not the product is experiencing an automatic error.
  - The operator's working range does not overlap for safety reasons.
